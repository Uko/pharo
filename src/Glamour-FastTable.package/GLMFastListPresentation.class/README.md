I'm a fast list presentation who introduces FTTableMorph into Glamour. 

Description 
-------------------

I just know how to render myself and I manage some options that the user can use for the FastTable.

The user can use almost all the functionalities of my superclass and some more. I work with a GLMMorphicFastListRenderer to render the list.  

Public API and Key Messages
-------------------

You can use the public API of my super class. You also use the public API of TGLMFastTableFunctionsPresentation (See his class comment) and you can finally use:

- #withSeparators 		I the input I receive is a collection of collection I will dispaly a list with separators between the collections.

Example
-------------------

GLMWrapper new 
	show: [ :a | 
		a fastList
			display: [ :x | 1 to: x ]];
	openOn: 1000.
	
or

GLMWrapper new 
	show: [ :a | 
		a fastList
				title: 'Example with an Outline List';
				display: [ :x | (x allSubclasses sort: [ :a :b | a asString < b asString  ]) collect: #allSubclasses  ];
				enableSearch;
				withSeparators
			];
	openOn: ProtoObject.
